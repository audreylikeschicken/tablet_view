            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9-year-old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <p>At night, just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <p>MiaoMiao is the best cat in the world, extremely social with others, and vigilant against strangers. Oftentimes you can find her running around the house looking for things to eat. If she consumed anything other than cat food, she immediately throws up.</p>
            <p>She is chill and chirpy. Loves to play with anything other than professional cat toys. Also loves sitting on keyboards and joining Zoom calls.</p>

            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn't causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven-foot-tall cat tree and sleeping.</p>
            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.</p>

            <img class="main_img" src="images/bear.JPG" alt="A fluffy black, white, and tan Shiba Inu with pointed ears named Bear." width="400">
            <p>Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun on his side and lounging. He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but eventually, he gets bored and just stops fetching them and lays down.</p>
            <p>Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn't like water (showers and even rain) or getting his nails clipped, and he's sometimes even so lazy that he'll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back home.</p>
